Hello! I am Sankalp Shekhar.

I'm a software engineer passionate about building things and exploring the fascinating interplay between technology and human behaviour.

## What Drives Me?

I’m driven by the excitement of turning ideas into solutions that matter. Whether it’s building a small tool to solve a problem or creating products that impact thousands, I love the process of bringing something to life. It’s the mix of curiosity, creativity, and constant learning that keeps me motivated to push boundaries and make a real difference.

## Beyond Code

I am a drummer and I enjoy listening to Rock and Jazz. I am also an F1 fan and curious about how businesses work. I am also an avid reader. Check out my reading list [here](/myblog/blog-random/random/reading-list/2025).

This blog is a space for me to share ideas, document my learnings, and connect with like-minded individuals. From AI trends to lessons from side projects, I hope you find something here that resonates with you.

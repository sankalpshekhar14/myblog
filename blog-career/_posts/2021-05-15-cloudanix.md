Today was my last day as an intern at Cloudanix. I cannot believe how quickly 4 months have passed by. This was my first proper internship, the first one in which I explored software development. It was great to learn, and I had the chance to work on a real-world problem, to design, implement and test solutions to it.

This post attempts to summarize my work at Cloudanix. It reflects upon all the learning in the last 4 months, and discussing how and what can be done to improve.
